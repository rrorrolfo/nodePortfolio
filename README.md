<h2 align="center">How it works</h2>

Data is being retrieved from a JSON file.

`Pug` templates are used, these templates retrieve data from the JSON file to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

`Node.js` and `Express` are used to:

-Import the required dependencies.<br>
-Link the JSON with the Pug templates.<br>
-Set up routes to handle requests.<br>
-Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS.<br>
-Handle errors.<br>
-Set up a server to serve the project.
